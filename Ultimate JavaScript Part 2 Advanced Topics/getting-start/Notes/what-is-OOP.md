Is a programming paradigm or style of programming centered around objects
rather than function.

## 4 pillars of Object-oriented Programming

1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

Before OOP we had Procedural Programming (functions on one side variables on the other side, they are decoupled), that divided a program into a set of 
of function. We had data stored in variables and functions that operate on the data
This style of pragramming leads to spaghetti code, there is so much interdependecy between all these function it become problematic to manage.

OOP came to solve this problem, in OOP we combine a group of related variables and functions into a unit. We call that unit an object.
we refer to these variable as Property and function as method().

- Example:
A car is an object with property:
- make, model, color
and methods like:
- start(), stop() and move()

## Encapsulation
So in OOP, we group related variables, and functions that oprate on them into objects. 

### Example:
 
 #### Procedural Prgramming
 One of the sympthome with Procedural code is function with so many paramters

 #### OOP
 Functions in OOP end up having few and few parameters.
 The fewer the number of paramter the easier it is to use and maintain that function.

 Uncle Bob - Robert  C  Martin once, said 'The best functions are those with no parameters'

 ## Abstraction
