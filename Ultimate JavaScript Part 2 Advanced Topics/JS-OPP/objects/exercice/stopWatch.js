 * Design a stopwatch object:
 * Define a const named sw, and set it to new Stopwatch
 * the object has a few members:
 * duration, which is a property as well as three methods:
 * reset(), start() and stop() 
 * 
 * other members are inherited from the base object.
 * 
 * Initially duractionis 0, we can start() the stopwatch
 * If we call start() again it will thro an error 'Stopwatch has already started.'
 * NOw, we can call stop(), we can not call stop() in a roll it will throw an error
 * 'Stopwatch is not started.'
 * We can access the duration property.
 * the stopWatch object count from the moment you call the start() method
 * until you call the stop() method to stop the object from countinuing counting.
 * 
 * when you call start(), the object start counting
 * when call stop(), it stops it from continuing counting
 * when call duration, it shows the time when stopwatch started and when it stop counting.
 * 
 * We can also call reset() method, takes the stopwatch to its initial state.
